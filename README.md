This project is about a profile (like in a social network). At first it is basic and very simple using only HTML and CSS.
The background image was taken from Pexels (https://www.pexels.com/pt-br/foto/vista-panoramica-da-montanha-rochosa-durante-a-noite-1624438/) and was chosen because I liked it how it refers to the universe, with the stars and mountains of stones.
The gradient in the profile photo was to make it more fun and casual.
The color palette used on the card was taken from the background image (#A8BBBF, #152526, #DCF2F2, #475951, #736A68) in contrast to the color #e66767 to give a good highlight where I think it's important do.
